Just a guy that likes learning about technology, science, and computers.  

### More Information

My interest in computers and technology started from a young age when I would play games and wonder how I could make a computer move a character forward when I pressed a button. I followed this up by going to codeacademy.com where I completed a few courses on programming basics. A few months to a year go by and I'm in high school where we have programming courses available to us. So I enrolled myself where I would later learn to program in Java focusing on software development.

A few years later, senior year, I began getting interested in cybersecurity and how systems can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, do things it's not supposed to, etc. Looking back I'm not sure why I didn't get interested in this field earlier being that I was developing software, but it's neither here nor there. Now we're here, I'm in college and learning more every day about naturally occurring vulnerabilities, what to look for, and even learning more about Unix operating systems every day.
